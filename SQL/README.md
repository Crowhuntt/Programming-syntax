Structured Query Language (SQL) is a domain-specific language used to manage data, especially in a relational database management system (RDBMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e., data incorporating relations among entities and variables.

The scope of SQL includes data query, data manipulation, data definition (schema creation and modification), and data access control:
- DDL (Data Definition Language): CREATE, ALTER, DROP
- DML (Data Manipulation Language): SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
- DCL (Data Control Language): GRANT, REVOKE
